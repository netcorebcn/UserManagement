# User management sample code

This code base provides example code supporting the following resources.

## Clean Coders videos
Sample code for [Humane Code](https://cleancoders.com/videos/humane-code-real) episodes 4 and 5:
- Episode 4. [Church Visitor](https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-4/show)
- Episode 5. [Preserved in translation](https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-5/show)

These videos discuss a sample C# code base, starting with a suboptimal structure, and gradually moves towards a better structure by applying **universal abstractions**.

Episodes 1-3 show other code that has nothing to do with this code base, but the're also worth watching.

## Blog articles
In addition to the above videos, the code in this repository also supports the article series [From interaction-based to state-based testing](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/02/18/from-interaction-based-to-state-based-testing).
